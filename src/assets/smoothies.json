Add 1 cup of the frozen fruit, a handful of spinach, and a teaspoon of chia seeds to each bag. Before sealing, make sure you squeeze as much air out as possible to prevent freezer burn. Seal and place in the freezer for later use. Once you’re ready to blend, empty contents of spinach smoothie bag into a high-speed blender.
